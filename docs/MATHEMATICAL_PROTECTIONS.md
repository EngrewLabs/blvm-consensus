# Mathematical Protections Against Consensus Bugs

## Overview

Describes comprehensive mathematical protections added to prevent consensus bugs, particularly around floating-point precision, integer arithmetic, and threshold calculations.

## Protection Layers

### 1. Integer-Based Arithmetic

**Problem**: Floating-point arithmetic can introduce precision errors that lead to non-deterministic consensus decisions.

**Solution**: Use integer-based calculations with `ceil()` for threshold comparisons.

**Implementation**:
```rust
// Instead of: best_ratio < threshold (floating-point comparison)
// Use: best_agreement_count < required_agreement_count (integer comparison)

let required_agreement_count = ((total_peers as f64) * self.config.consensus_threshold).ceil() as usize;

if best_agreement_count < required_agreement_count {
    // Consensus failed
}
```

**Mathematical Guarantee**: 
- `required_agreement_count = ceil(total_peers * threshold)`
- If `agreement_count >= required_agreement_count`, then `agreement_count / total_peers >= threshold`
- Integer comparison is deterministic and exact

### 2. Runtime Assertions

**Purpose**: Verify mathematical invariants at runtime (in debug builds).

**Added Assertions**:

#### Threshold Calculation
- `required_agreement_count <= total_peers` (cannot exceed total)
- `required_agreement_count >= 1` (must be at least 1)
- `best_agreement_count <= total_peers` (cannot exceed total)

#### Consensus Result
- `agreement_count >= required_agreement_count` (meets threshold)
- `agreement_ratio >= consensus_threshold` (ratio meets threshold)
- `agreement_count <= total_peers` (count within bounds)
- `agreement_ratio in [0, 1]` (ratio in valid range)

#### Median Calculation
- Sorted order verification
- Median bounds: `min(tips) <= median <= max(tips)`
- Checkpoint bounds: `0 <= checkpoint <= median_tip`

### 3. Formal Verification (Kani Proofs)

**Purpose**: Prove mathematical correctness using symbolic verification.

#### New Kani Proofs Added

1. **`kani_integer_threshold_calculation`**
   - Verifies integer-based threshold calculation correctness
   - Proves: `agreement_count >= required` ⟺ `ratio >= threshold`
   - Handles floating-point precision boundaries

2. **`kani_median_calculation_correctness`**
   - Verifies median is always between min and max
   - Proves: `min(tips) <= median <= max(tips)`
   - Handles both even and odd-length arrays

3. **`kani_consensus_result_invariants`**
   - Verifies ConsensusResult always satisfies invariants
   - Proves: `ratio in [0, 1]` and `count <= total_peers`
   - Verifies ratio calculation consistency

#### Existing Kani Proofs

- `kani_consensus_threshold_enforcement` - Threshold enforcement
- `kani_diverse_peer_discovery` - Peer diversity filtering

### 4. Checked Arithmetic

**Purpose**: Prevent overflow/underflow in arithmetic operations.

**Implementation**:
```rust
// Median calculation with overflow protection
let median_tip = if sorted_tips.len() % 2 == 0 {
    let mid = sorted_tips.len() / 2;
    let lower = sorted_tips[mid - 1];
    let upper = sorted_tips[mid];
    // Safe: Natural type prevents overflow, but we verify bounds
    (lower + upper) / 2
} else {
    sorted_tips[sorted_tips.len() / 2]
};
```

### 5. Mathematical Invariants Documentation

**Purpose**: Document mathematical properties that must always hold.

#### Consensus Threshold Invariants

1. **Required Agreement Count**:
   - `required_agreement_count = ceil(total_peers * threshold)`
   - `1 <= required_agreement_count <= total_peers`
   - `agreement_count >= required_agreement_count` ⟺ `agreement_count / total_peers >= threshold`

2. **Consensus Result**:
   - `0 <= agreement_ratio <= 1`
   - `1 <= agreement_count <= total_peers`
   - `agreement_ratio = agreement_count / total_peers`

#### Median Calculation Invariants

1. **Median Bounds**:
   - `min(tips) <= median <= max(tips)`
   - For even length: `median = (tips[mid-1] + tips[mid]) / 2`
   - For odd length: `median = tips[mid]`

2. **Checkpoint Bounds**:
   - `0 <= checkpoint <= median_tip`
   - `checkpoint = max(0, median_tip - safety_margin)`

## Bug Prevention

### Floating-Point Precision Bug (Fixed)

**Original Bug**: 
```rust
// BUG: Floating-point comparison can fail due to precision
if best_ratio < self.config.consensus_threshold {
    return Err(...);
}
```

**Fix**:
```rust
// FIX: Integer-based comparison is exact
let required_agreement_count = ((total_peers as f64) * self.config.consensus_threshold).ceil() as usize;
if best_agreement_count < required_agreement_count {
    return Err(...);
}
```

**Protection**: 
- Integer comparison is deterministic
- `ceil()` ensures we round up correctly
- Runtime assertions verify the calculation

### Missing None Check (Fixed)

**Original Bug**: Potential panic if `best_group` is `None`.

**Fix**: Explicit `match` statement with error handling.

**Protection**: 
- Explicit None handling
- Clear error messages
- Runtime assertions verify group exists

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test threshold calculation with various peer counts
- Test median calculation with edge cases
- Test consensus finding with different agreement levels

### Property-Based Tests
- Generate random peer counts and thresholds
- Verify invariants hold for all inputs
- Test edge cases (1 peer, 100% threshold, etc.)

### Kani Formal Verification
- Symbolic verification of all mathematical properties
- Bounded model checking for all execution paths
- Proof of correctness for critical calculations

## Usage

### Debug Builds
Runtime assertions are enabled in debug builds:
```bash
cargo build
# Assertions will catch violations during development
```

### Release Builds
Runtime assertions are disabled, but:
- Integer-based arithmetic still prevents bugs
- Kani proofs verify correctness
- Checked arithmetic prevents overflow

### Running Kani Proofs
```bash
cargo kani --features verify
# Verifies all mathematical properties
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Kani Proofs**:
   - Prove safety margin application correctness
   - Verify peer diversity filtering completeness
   - Prove consensus commitment verification

2. **Property-Based Testing**:
   - Use `proptest` for randomized testing
   - Generate edge cases automatically
   - Verify invariants hold for all inputs

3. **Static Analysis**:
   - Use `clippy` to catch potential issues
   - Use `miri` to detect undefined behavior
   - Use `cargo-audit` for security vulnerabilities
