# Contributing to consensus-proof

Thank you for your interest in contributing to consensus-proof! This document contains repo-specific guidelines. See the [BTCDecoded Contribution Guide](https://github.com/BTCDecoded/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for general guidelines.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). By participating, you agree to uphold this code.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue, please:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Check the documentation** to ensure it's not a usage question
3. **Verify the issue** with the latest version

For security issues, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Make your changes** following our guidelines
4. **Add tests** for new functionality
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Submit a pull request**

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use `rustfmt` and `clippy` for code formatting and linting:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

### Testing Requirements

**All code must be thoroughly tested:**

- **Unit tests** for all new functions
- **Integration tests** for cross-module functionality
- **Edge case testing** for boundary conditions
- **Property-based testing** where applicable

**Test coverage must be >95%** for consensus-critical code.

### Consensus Rules

**CRITICAL:** This code implements Bitcoin consensus rules. Any changes must:

1. **Match Bitcoin Core behavior exactly**
2. **Not deviate from the Orange Paper specifications**
3. **Handle all edge cases correctly**
4. **Maintain mathematical precision**

### Documentation

- **All public APIs** must be documented
- **Complex algorithms** need detailed comments
- **Mathematical formulas** should reference the Orange Paper
- **Examples** should be provided for key functions

### Performance

- **No performance regressions** without justification
- **Benchmark new code** against existing implementations
- **Consider memory usage** for consensus-critical operations
- **Profile hot paths** regularly

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Git
- A text editor or IDE

### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BTCDecoded/consensus-proof
cd consensus-proof
cargo build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with coverage
cargo tarpaulin --out Html

# Run specific test categories
cargo test --test integration_tests
cargo test --test comprehensive_unit_tests
```

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
cargo bench
```

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Examples:**
```
feat(script): add OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY implementation
fix(pow): correct difficulty adjustment calculation
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(block): add edge case tests for block validation
```

## Review Process

### Pull Request Requirements

- [ ] **All tests pass**
- [ ] **Code is formatted** (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] **No clippy warnings** (`cargo clippy`)
- [ ] **Documentation is updated**

3. **Test coverage** - Are all cases covered?
4. **Performance** - No regressions?
5. **Documentation** - Is it clear and complete?
6. **Security** - Any potential vulnerabilities?

### Approval Process

- **At least 2 approvals** required for consensus-critical changes
- **Security team review** for cryptographic changes
- **Performance review** for hot path changes
- **Documentation review** for API changes

## Release Process

### Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
