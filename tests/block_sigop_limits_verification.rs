//! Block SigOp Cost Limits Verification Tests
//!
//! Tests to verify BLLVM's block sigop cost limits match consensus exactly.
//! Sigop cost limits are consensus-critical - differences = chain split.
//!
//! Consensus limit:
//! - MAX_BLOCK_SIGOPS_COST = 80,000
//! - Cost = (legacy_sigops × 4) + (p2sh_sigops × 4) + witness_sigops
