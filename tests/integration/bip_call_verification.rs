//! Verification that BIP validation functions are actually called
//!
//! This module uses a technique to verify that BIP checks are called:
//! - Creates blocks that MUST be rejected if BIP checks are called
//! - If blocks are accepted, it means BIP checks are NOT being called (BUG)

use blvm_consensus::*;
use blvm_consensus::block::connect_block;

/// Test that verifies BIP30 check is called by creating a known-violating block
///
/// This test will FAIL if BIP30 check is removed from connect_block.
/// See bip_enforcement_tests.rs for the actual implementation.
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "CRITICAL BUG")]
fn verify_bip30_check_called() {
    // Empty: would construct BIP30-violating block and assert connect_block panics
}

/// Test that verifies BIP34 check is called by creating a known-violating block
#[test]

fn verify_bip34_check_called() {
    // This test is designed to panic if BIP34 check is NOT called
